Code used for the paper Thomas, Pamela Bilo, Daniel H. Robertson, and Nitesh V. Chawla. "Predicting onset of complications from diabetes: a graph based approach." Applied network science 3, no. 1 (2018): 48: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41109-018-0106-z

This analysis was written specifically for the healthcare data that was provided to us. Since this data contains sensitive healthcare data, it will not be available for public use. However, we hope that our appraoch can be helpful for people using their own healthcare data.

Our data consists of four files: diagnosis data, which contains ICD-9 and 10 codes, demographic data, continuous clinical data, and qualitative clinical data. These data types are analyzed in read_diagnosis_data.py, read_demographic_file.py, read_clin_var_file.py, and read_clin_var_file_status.py. Each of these output files that will be used for further analysis.

Our analysis then creates a homogenous network of these data through the Create_DAG_Spark.py file. Then, data analysis is done through the readpythongraph_spark.py and dataanalysis_spark.py files. Finally, predictions are made using the predict_spark.py file.

Please refer to call_python_graph_spark.sh to understand how the files are called. Each Python file takes in arguments directing the code to the type of complication that is being analyzed. Additionally, read_diagnosis_data.py takes in a string consisting of ICD-9 or 10 codes that are used to code for the particular complication. Predict_spark.py also takes an argument that makes a prediction based upon how many edges will be included in the final output.
